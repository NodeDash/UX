# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are currently in early development (`v0.1`), and things are changing rapidly. Security is a priority, and we welcome reports from the community.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes              |
| < 0.1   | ❌ No               |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please help us keep our users safe by following responsible disclosure practices:

- **Do not** open a public issue.
- **Do not** disclose security vulnerabilities in public forums, issues, or discussions.

Instead, please email us directly at **hello@trackpac.io**. Include as much detail as possible so we can reproduce and address the issue quickly.

We aim to respond ASAP and will reply with a timeline for a fix.

## Early-Stage Notice

As this is a `v0.1` release, the codebase may change significantly over time. We are working toward a stable and secure `v1.0`, and your input is invaluable.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure.
